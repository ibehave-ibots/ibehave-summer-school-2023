## Teachers Reference: Workshop Instructions

### 1. Description

Welcome to the workshop! In this hands-on session, participants will work collaboratively in teams of 4-5 individuals to create their own interactive dashboards. The dashboards will be developed using a series of contributions, and teams will be ranked based on their contributions. The top two dashboards will be showcased on the main screen, and the ultimate winner will be determined through a voting process.

**Understanding "Contributions":** A contribution refers to a single commit that signifies a change in the dashboard.

### 2. Working as a Team

To ensure effective teamwork, adhere to the following process:

1. Members will take turns making contributions to the dashboard.
2. After completing your contribution, pass the laptop to the person seated on your right.

### 3. Rules

In order to maintain a fair and structured environment, the following rules must be followed:

- Each team is allowed to use only one laptop.
- Every member can contribute once and only once (equivalent to a single commit) during their turn.
- The laptop should be passed to the right, except when it needs to reach the first person in the row.
- For safety reasons, laptops must remain on the table at all times.
- Teams have the option to designate a "free" member who can interact with other groups for inspiration. It's important to note that the free member must still contribute during their turn, and their turn cannot be skipped.

### 4. Setup

Before diving into the workshop, ensure the following aspects are set up:

#### 4.1 Repository (Repo)

The repository is organized into branches for each round of the workshop, ensuring a clear separation of work. Additionally, each team will have its dedicated branch for each round, created from the corresponding round's branch. This branch structure streamlines the instantiation of the development environment and facilitates collaborative coding.

To simplify the process, we have added badges within the repository's README. These badges are clickable links that enable teams to effortlessly access their corresponding team branch in a Gitpod environment. In this environment, all required libraries will be automatically installed, ensuring a seamless start to the development process.

#### 4.2 Workspace (Room)

The workshop space should be arranged in a linear configuration, with teams seated in a row, facing the front of the room. The room's focal point will be the scoreboard display, where the progress and contributions of each team will be showcased. This setup encourages active engagement and easy visibility of the scoreboard updates.

The workshop is designed to accommodate up to 10 teams, with each team comprising 3-5 members. To keep track of time during each round of the workshop, a visible clock should be provided, ensuring that each team adheres to the designated time frame. We have prepared data for two rounds, and each round is expected to last between 40 to 80 minutes, fostering a balanced and productive session.

#### 4.3 Scoreboard

The scoreboard serves as a dynamic visual representation of each team's contributions and progress throughout the workshop. The scoreboard's code is housed within the iBOTS tools GitHub repository. As teams make contributions, their scores and achievements will be updated on the scoreboard, which will be prominently displayed at the front of the room.

Teams will be ranked based on their contributions, fostering healthy competition and encouraging active participation. The scoreboard is designed to be used for each round separately. The teacher will play a key role in managing the scoreboard, ensuring accurate updates and providing a clear overview of the workshop's dynamics.

### 5. Instructions

Follow these steps to guide participants through the workshop:

#### 5.1 Opening the Development Environment

1. Click on the designated link corresponding to your team number to access the development environment. If prompted, log in to GitHub.

#### 5.2 Preparing for Development

1. Verify the presence of the **data/round1.csv** file.
2. Open the **round1.py** file.
3. In the terminal, execute the command `streamlit run round1.py`. This action will display links in the terminal, but there's no need to manually click on them.

#### 5.3 Accessing the Dashboard

1. Go to the **PORTS** tab.
2. Locate the port named "Streamlit Dashboard."
3. Two options are available to open your dashboard:
   - Click the provided link to launch the dashboard in your browser.
   - Alternatively, use another provided link to open the dashboard within the development environment.
4. Once the dashboard is visible and displays a title and text, you're ready to proceed!

#### 5.4 Making Contributions

1. Introduce changes to the code as required.
2. Open the **Source Control** Panel (Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + G).
3. Add all changes to the stage by clicking the **+** sign in the **Changes** section.
4. Craft a succinct commit message that explains the modifications made (e.g., "added title").
5. Press Ctrl + Enter to confirm the commit.
6. Utilize **Sync Changes** to upload the commit remotely and contribute to the team's score.
7. Keep up the great work!

By following these organized instructions, participants will have a clear understanding of the workshop's dynamics, rules, setup, and development process. This approach aims to foster collaborative learning and creative engagement throughout the workshop.
